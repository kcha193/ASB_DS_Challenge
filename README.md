# ASB_DS_Challenge

There are three main files below: 

+ `DS_challenge_report.Rmd`: Rmarkdown file contains both the R code and commentaries. 
+ `DS_challenge_report.html`: Compiled HTML report with all the tables, outputs and plots from the R code.
+ `DS_challenge_report.R`: R script file contains R code from the Rmarkdown file.

The other files in the `Rcode` folder contains some of my rough initial workings.
